        She's a four-year-old rescue cat and has been living with my neighbor
        for a year.
        <br />
        And like all cats, she is weird.
        <br />
        <br />
        The research on what causes cats to behave so derpy has probably started
        since Ancient Egypt.
        <br />
        But even to this day, we can never truly know what's going inside their
        head.
        <br />
        <br />
        We decided to give it a try, and see how much we could understand a cat
        in two days of cat-sitting, six hours a day.
        <br />
        We then wrote down our findings in pseudocode that replicated the cat's
        behavior.
        <br />
        Ahead of you is the journal of our weekend with Jilly, our neighbor's
        lovely cat, and our adventure to deepen our knowledge of cats.

        Based on our extensive research on cats through Wikipedia, we decided to
        use these research data for the basis for creating a cat.
