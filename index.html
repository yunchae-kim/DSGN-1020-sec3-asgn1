        She's a four-year-old rescue cat and has been living with my neighbor
        for a year. And like all cats, she is weird.
        <br />
        <br />
        The research on what causes cats to behave so derpy has probably started
        since Ancient Egypt.
        <br />
        But even to this day, we can never truly know what's going inside their
        head.
        <br />
        <br />
        So we decided to give it a try, and see how much we could understand a
        cat in two days of cat-sitting, six hours a day.
        <br />
        We then wrote down our findings in pseudocode that replicated the cat's
        behavior.
        <br />
        Below is the journal of our weekend with Jilly, and our adventure to
        deepen our knowledge of cats.

        Based on our extensive research on cats through Wikipedia, we decided to

        On our first day, we discovered some personality traits about Jilly.
        <br />
        She was very agreeable in terms that she was open to human touch and
        quite affectionate. <br />
        She wasn't suspicious of us, meaning she had a rather low neuroticism.
        <br />
        She was not quite active, but still active enough to play with toys.
        <br />
        We also noticed that when we petted her back, her posture changed.
        <br />
        However, when we did this for a prolonged time she became overwhelmed
        and twitched to move away from our hand.

        We modified our code according to our time spent with Jilly.

        By the time we got back the next day, Jilly was sleeping. When she woke
        up she was very clingy. <br />
        We weren't sure if it was because of the loneliness or because she was
        hungry. <br />
        We tested out if we could mitigate both hunger and loneliness by
        spanking her while eating. <br />
        She normally wouldn't let us spank her, but she seemed fine with it when
        she was eating.

        We modified the code according to our discovery.

        We also learned that Jilly already knew how to do high-fives, or maybe
        she just responds to human hands.
        <br />
        As a prize, we let her get snacks from the box until we eventually had
        to stop her because she kept on eating.
        <br />
        Besides that, we spent our last day playing with her for some time and
        feeding her meal.

        The two-day journal of observing Jilly ends here.
        <br />
        There were some characteristics that we set initially and couldn't find
        out about her, but we also got to add more functions.
        <br />
        Jilly was very cooperative and we were glad that we were able to know
        more about cats through the observation.
